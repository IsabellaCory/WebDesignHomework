            This song is about a guy contemplating the use of black magic, voodoo, or "santeria" - anything he can to get back his girl. The lyric was written by Sublime lead singer Brad Nowell, who died two months before the album was released.

            Santeria means "Way of The Saints" in Spanish, and is a religion where the focus is on worship of saints. It is practiced in Cuba, Brazil, Panama, and a few other countries. There are some followers of Santeria in California, where the band is from.

          An early version of this song appears as an instrumental called "Lincoln Highway Dub" on Sublime's second album, Robbin' The Hood, released in 1994.

           The music video was made about a month after Brad Nowell died. The video contains ghostly images of Brad playing his guitar along with the band, which was created by using old concert footage of him.

           The clip was directed by McG, who later became a big time movie-maker (Charlie's Angels, Terminator Salvation), and stars Tom Lister, Jr., who wrestled under the name Zeus and appeared in a number of movies and TV shows as a big, scary man.

          Nowell's Dalmation, Lou Dog, has a starring role in the video, but in most of the scenes a trained lookalike dog was used, since Lou didn't take direction well and at one point bit Lister.

            Sublime formed in 1988 and released two albums on their own label before getting deal with MCA, which issued their self-titled album in 1996 two months after lead singer Brad Nowell died of a heroin overdose at age 28. The band was little known at the time outside of their home base of Long Beach, California, and Nowell's death got little national coverage.

            His bandmates later re-formed as the Long Beach Dub Allstars, but there was no Sublime to promote the album. When MCA sent promotional copies of "What I Got" to US radio stations, it got some heat and suddenly the defunct band was on the air and in demand. "Santeria" was the next single pushed to radio, and it was well-received, garnering most of its airplay in early 1997, almost a year after the album was released. "Wrong Way" was then sent to stations, followed by "Doin' Time," keeping Sublime on the airwaves well into 1998.

            None of these songs were made available for sale as singles in America, which ramped up album sales. Sublime ended up selling over 5 million copies despite the death of their frontman.
