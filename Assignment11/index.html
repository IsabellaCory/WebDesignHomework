        <p> <b>The Pygmalion Effect</b>  is a psychological phenomenon in which high expectations lead to improved performance in a given area and low expectations lead to worse performance.</p>
        <p>
            Examples of the phenomenon in romantic relationships: people tend to behave more like their partner's expectation of them. Suppose one expects their partner to treat them well and do their share of housework. In that case, the Pygmalion Effect in relationships states that both partners will probably change their behavior to meet the expectation.

            <span id="uppercase">Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson </span> first introduced the concept in 1968.

            It is a positive form of self-fulfilling prophecy wherein the objects [the targeted individuals] of projections internalize the optimistic labels they receive and succeed to conform to those labels. This implies that sanguine expectations on a leaderâ€™s part could lead to improved performance by followers.
