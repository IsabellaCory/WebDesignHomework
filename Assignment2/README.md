# Assignment 2 #
This is the repository for **Assignment 2**
I am using it to practive *markdown*
1. I used '#'s and a space to creating a heading
2. I used ** on each side of text to make it bold and just one * on each side makes it italic
3. I made a list with numbers and a period.
   - I used a - for bulleted list

I used a space between lines to create a paragraph
